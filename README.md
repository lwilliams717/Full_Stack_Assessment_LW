# Full Stack Assesment
## Introduction
You will be implementing an Android application using Android Studio that will call the national weather api and populate the forecast on a screen.

All reasources and architecture has been provided to you. It will be your job to implement these resources into a functioning weather forecast app.

This should take approximately 2-3 hours to complete, please keep track of your time as you go and get as much done as you can.

## The UI
The following are the two screens we would like to see implmented.

</p>

### Screen #1 
Should be implmented as closely as possible to the provided screen. Margins, text size, and shades of colors don't have to be precise.

### Screen #2
Should consist of a textview on top and a forecast card. 

This forecast should have a corresponding:
- icon
- time of day
- temperature

If the Api fails to call then display the failure in the textView


## Function 

When Screen #1's forecast button is pressed the application should initialize the forecast activity, which will call the national weather api for the forecast of a given location.

Calling the weather api is a two step process.

- The first step is to send a location request. The response will be two grid cooordinates. 

- The second step will be to send a forescast request with the previously given grid coordinates. The response will be the finale forecast for the next couple of days.

## When Finished

When you have completed the assessment, email molly@ascentitech.com with the link to your new repository and answer the following questions as honestly as you can.  

## Final Questions
1) How long did the assessment take to complete?  Was there any task that took significantly longer than the others, and if so why?
The assessment took me
The only task that took my a while was using the Retrofit async API call. I was having some trouble updating the RecyclerView inside of the activity because the variables updated in the request exist on a separate thread.
I found a way around it based on what I've seen from a few online resources.
And something that might seem weird upon initial review, I was experiencing an issue where the shortForecast for a period would not always display a short message. Occasionally,
it would display an entire sentence. I figured I wouldn't have enough time to do any sophisticated String parsing, so some of the images are populated using the icon link in from the API and the Picasso image library.
Therefore, any shortForecasts that didn't have a mapping would just be populated using Picasso.

2) Were there any tasks that you initially did not know how to complete? And if so, how did you approach them and take the steps to learn how to complete them? (Itâ€™s okay if the answer is yes! Everyone learns on the job at some point)
Yes, I have never used Retrofit before to do API requests. I am more familiar with AndroidVolley requests. 
But, I did a lot of research into how to use Retrofit and used the code that was already given in the template to figure out how to do the API request for the Weather. The sample code was extremely helpful (and well written!) :)

3) Was this assessment feasible for the time given and relatively easy to follow? Any points of feedback? 
It was very feasible given the allotted time.
